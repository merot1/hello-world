Hi Humans!

James I. here, I like java and javascript (I would love an extra-cheese pizza right now!).
I've had no tocas on the moon but, would love to try some.
I own a 90 lbs. mouse (does anything for cheese) that disguises herself as a dog.  At the minimum, she understands key words in a sentence so, she appears to understand many things that you say. When she pops a willy, she is saying yes or that she wants to go.
